# Personal Portfolio Page

This is a Personal Portfolio Page project created as part of my **Responsive Web Design Certification** from FreeCodeCamp. The project demonstrates the ability to build a static webpage using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The Portfolio Page is designed to present a selection of my projects, along with links to their GitHub repositories. The page is structured with a navigation bar, a welcome section, a projects gallery, and contact information. The design incorporates responsive elements, modern CSS techniques, and interactive features to enhance the user experience.
